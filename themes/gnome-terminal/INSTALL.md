### [Gnome Terminal](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Terminal)

#### Activating theme

This theme is compatible with **Gnome 3 Terminal** and any other _Gnome-based_ terminal program like the **Unity Terminal** bundled with Ubuntu.

You'll need the `dconf` command (if you run a recent Gnome version). In Ubuntu-based distros, you can install it by running:

```bash
sudo apt-get install dconf-cli
```

In other distros, you must find it and search your repositories for **dconf** related packages.

After installing `dconf`, choose the variant and navigate to the folder and then run the installation script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

#### Addons

You can complement your experience by installing Addons like [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md), allowing the commands to have their colors and styles.
